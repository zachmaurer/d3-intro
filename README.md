# D3 Introduction

These are slides from a presentation on D3.js given by me and [Alec Glassford](https://github.com/alecglassford) to students in Stanford's [CS448B: Data Visualization](https://magrawala.github.io/cs448b-fa17/), taught by Maneesh Argawala.


(Unfortunately, some of the handy .gif's in the presentation don't really translate well to PDF.)
